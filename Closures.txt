//closure definition
//A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, 
// the outer function's scope, and the global scope, even after the outer function has returned.

//Example of closure    
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
    return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
        console.log('Outer Variable: ' + outerVariable);
        console.log('Inner Variable: ' + innerVariable);
    }
}

const newFunction = outerFunction('outside');
newFunction('inside');
